# Constant Time Complexity `O(1)`

We have established that `constant` time complexity is when the runtime is always the same, no matter how big the input is. `Linear` time complexity is when the runtime scales linearly with the input. To describe this in Big O notation, we use `O(1)` (pronounced "O of 1" or "big O of 1").

Let's look at an example of a constant time O(1) function.

```js
function accessElement(arr, index) {
  return arr[index];
}
```

This function takes in an array and an index and returns the element at that index. No matter how big the array is, the runtime will always be the same because it is only doing one operation. We can describe this function as `O(1)` in Big O notation.

We can test this in VS Code by adding the following to a .js file:

```js
function accessElement(arr, index) {
  return arr[index];
}

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.time('Access Element 1');
console.log(accessElement(arr1, 1));
console.timeEnd('Access Element 1');

const arr2 = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, index) => index + 1);

console.time('Access Element 2');
console.log(accessElement(arr2, 1));
console.timeEnd('Access Element 2');
```

With the `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` functions, we can see how long it takes to run the code between them.

`Access Element 1` passes in an array with 5 elements and `Access Element 2` passes in an array with 10,000 elements.

Run the code either by right-clicking and selecting `Run Code` or by running it in the terminal with `node <filename>.js`.

All of you will get a different result. As I said in the last lesson, there are so many factors including your computer, your operating system, and what other programs you have running. Also, the way that your computer allocates memory can affect the runtime. The one truth is that if you increase the size of the array, the runtime will still stay in the same general range.

Change the length of the array in `Access Element 2` to 100,000 and run the code again.

```js
const arr2 = Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, index) => index + 1);
```

You should see that the runtime is still in the same general range.
