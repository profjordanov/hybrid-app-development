# Depth First Traversal

Now we are going to get into some algorithms that involve binary trees. This one is called `Depth First Traversal`. This is a traversal algorithm where the algorithm starts at a `root` node, which we know is the one at the top of the tree with no parent, and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

So if we look at the following tree:

<img src=".../../assets/images/depth-first.png" width="500" alt="" />

We would start at `a` and then go to `b`. From here, we would go to `d` because we are going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. `d` is as far as we can go on this path because it is a `leaf node`, which means it has no children. So now we can move over to `e`. If `e` had a child, we would move down, but since it doesn't, we're going to move over to `c`. From `c`, we can move down in depth to `f`.

So this pattern would be `a`, `b`, `d`, `e`, `c`, `f`.

Now we want to implement this algorithm. We are going to use a `stack` to implement this algorithm because we want to keep track of the nodes we have visited. Remember a stack is a `LIFO` data structure, which means `Last In First Out`. So the last node we visit will be the first node we pop off the stack. When a node is popped off or removed from the stack, we can say that node has been `visited`. When a node is popped off the stack, it will be put in a variable called `current`. We will then check if `current` has a right child. If it does, we will add it to the stack. If it doesn't, we will check if it has a left child. If it does, we will add it to the stack. If it doesn't, we will pop the next node off the stack and repeat the process.

Let's implement this in JavaScript. We will use the same `Node` class we used in the previous lesson. We will first use a standard array as our stack, but then I wan to implement the `Stack` class that we created a few lessons ago.

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function depthFirstTraversal(root) {
  if (!root) {
    return [];
  }

  const result = [];
  const stack = [];

  stack.push(root);

  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const current = stack.pop();
    result.push(current.data);

    if (current.right) {
      stack.push(current.right);
    }

    if (current.left) {
      stack.push(current.left);
    }
  }

  return result;
}

module.exports = {
  Node,
  depthFirstTraversal,
};
```

We did exactly what I described above. We first check if the `root` node exists. If it doesn't, we return an empty array.

We then create a `result` array and a `stack` array. We then push the `root` node onto the stack.

We then start a `while` loop that will run as long as the `stack` array has a length greater than `0`. Inside the `while` loop, we pop the last node off the stack and add it to the `result` array.

We then check if the `current` node has a right child. If it does, we add it to the stack. We then check if the `current` node has a left child. If it does, we add it to the stack.

We then repeat the process until the `stack` array has a length of `0`. We then return the `result` array.

## Using the Stack Class

Now, let's refactor this code to use the `Stack` class we created a few lessons ago. You can do this as a challenge, or you can look at the code below. I will also add a test to make sure the code works.

```js
const Stack = require('./stack');

class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function depthFirstTraversal(root) {
  if (!root) {
    return [];
  }

  const result = [];
  const stack = new Stack();

  stack.push(root);

  while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
    const current = stack.pop();
    result.push(current.data);

    if (current.right) {
      stack.push(current.right);
    }

    if (current.left) {
      stack.push(current.left);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

This code is very similar, except we used a pre-defined `Stack` class instead of a standard array. We also used the `isEmpty()` method instead of checking the length of the array.

## Test Cases

```js
const { Node, depthFirstTraversal } = require('./depth-first-traversal');

describe('Depth First Traversal', () => {
  test('Should perform depth-first traversal on the binary tree', () => {
    // Create a binary tree:      a
    //                          /   \
    //                         b     c
    //                        / \    /
    //                       d   e  f

    const root = new Node('a');
    const nodeB = new Node('b');
    const nodeC = new Node('c');
    const nodeD = new Node('d');
    const nodeE = new Node('e');
    const nodeF = new Node('f');

    root.left = nodeB;
    root.right = nodeC;
    nodeB.left = nodeD;
    nodeB.right = nodeE;
    nodeC.left = nodeF;

    expect(depthFirstTraversal(root)).toEqual(['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'f']);
  });

  test('Should return an empty array for an empty tree', () => {
    expect(depthFirstTraversal(null)).toEqual([]);
  });

  test('Should handle a tree with only the root node', () => {
    const root = new Node('root');
    expect(depthFirstTraversal(root)).toEqual(['root']);
  });
});
```
