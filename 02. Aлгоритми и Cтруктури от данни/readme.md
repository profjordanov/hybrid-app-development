# JS Challenges, Data Structures, and Algorithms
JJ UE-Varna 2024
## File Structure

Each folder includes:

- `readme.md` - The challenge/code instructions. This also includes hints, tests and a dropdown with the solution code as well as the explanation of the solution code.
- `[name].js` - This is your working file. It has the name of the function and the function is exported. No parameters are passed to the function. That is up to you to add.
- `[name]-run.js` - File to run the code manually. The function is already imported and called with expected parameters.
- `[name]-solution.js` The solution code with heavy commenting. Some challenges have multiple solutions. If you want the solution without comments, look in the `readme.md` file.
- `[name]-test.js` - Jest tests for the solution code. You will need to rename this file to `[name].test.js` to run the tests.

## Learning Modules/Lessons

Some lessons/modules are not challenges, they are more like mini-lessons. I don't just throw you a challenge using a new concept (Trees, Stacks, Bubble Sorts, etc) without explaining it first. I try to explain the concept and then give you a challenge to practice or implement it. So some folders will not have a challenge, just a readme file.

## Running Tests

In order for the Jest tests to run, you need to rename the test file to `[name].test.js`. For example, if you are working on the `hello-world` challenge, you need to rename the `hello-world-test.js` file to `hello-world.test.js`. This is because Jest looks for files with the `.test.js` extension.

Run the command `npm run test` from the root directory and it will run all the tests.

## These Don't Have to be "Challenges"

Some people, such as myself are not great at doing this stuff off the top of their head. Even though most of the code is setup as a challenge, you can certainly just follow along with the course and/or just study the solutions and learn from them.

You can use the tests to see if your code passes, but use the `run` files to run the code manually. This is so that you can experiment, console.log, etc.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run test` to run the tests. Again, you will need to rename the test files and replace the `-test` with `.test` to run the tests.

## Index of Challenges/Lessons

#### 01. Basic Challenges 1

These are mostly challenges that have to do with loops, conditionals, and string manipulation. I do not go over fundamentals like "what is a for loop". You should already know the basics of JavaScript.
